# React Seasons App

This is for learning more about Class Components and the fundamentals

Kowalski, are you there?

## App Summary
- In this Application I went into depth regarding React Class Components and State
- This application uses Geolocation to provide the latitude of a user's location
- `Date.getMonth()` is used to provide the numerical value of what month the user is visiting the app in
- With both of these tools the user is then provided a display of either Summer of Winter
- Conditionals to provide handling cases of user declining location, no error message and loading
- What was learned:
  - Benefits and rules of Class Components
  - Component life cycles
  - Class component functions
  - State that handled user input and respond to data-loading events
  - Rules of State and State vs Props
  - Conditional statements within `render()` and within a Helper function

- React Seasons App is basic and retrieves/load data from the user
- There are no inputs that are present for the user but one `'input'` would be the user interaction of allowing/declining the location
- This input helps find/get the data of the latitude from the user
- Overall Parent App holds State for the entirety of application
